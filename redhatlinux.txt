/--> root directory or parent directory like c drive in wnd
Linux Homedirectory=Users in windows
Sri
Vam
bin:
each command binary files are there like mkdir ls cd date etc

sbin:(system binaries)
it contains some binary files like shutdown start reboot adduser

Types of Users:
root user /super user:  only one rootuser which is root when we create server it will create
normal users: sri vam raj mahi
system users: It is created by third party softwares : jenkins, tomcat

Diff b/w bin and sbin:
The binaries which are available in sbin only can accessible by root user only
 The binaries which are available in bin can accessible by every user

etc:
it contains all the configuration files like shadow passwd groups sudoers motd

lib:(libraries):
it contains libraries which used by OS.

Q:what is root user home directory?
A:/root


Basic Commands:
mkdir
mkdir -v : v means verbose it displays directory created
mkdir -p devops/linux/shell/git/maven  :-p means parent
mkdir  devops/linux/shell/git/maven/tomcat : it will work
mkdir  devops/linux/shell/git/maven/jenkins/tomcat : it won't work bcoz jenkins dir not created.
Solution is  mkdir -p devops/linux/shell/git/maven/jenkins/tomcat :now it will work bcoz it will create jenkins and tomcat folders.

mkdir -m : m means mode
mkdir -m 700 directoryname: with created directory has 700 permissions.
ls:
ls -l
ls -la :hidden files
ls -lh : human readable format
ls -lt : timestamp manner it displays
ls -ltr: reverse timestamp

Q:what is inode?    i=index number
A:It is a data structure it store the file or information like permissions,foldername,group,size,timestamp etc
it contains file or dir
to see inode number ls -li.inode number used by OS.

rmdir : to delete directory.it delete empty directory only.
rm -rf directoryname.-->it deletes non-empty directories.
rm : to delete empty files.
rm -f : to delete non-empty files.

Q:How to find all the empty files in current directory?
A: find . type f -empty  --> . means current dir and f means file.
   find ~ type f -empty  empty files in current user home dir.
   find / type f -empty  empty files in server 
   find / type d -empty  empty dir in server
   sudo find . -type d -name "test" to find test directory in current user
   sudo find . -type d -name "test" -ls for list add -ls

How to set user umask value permanently?
goto user home--->.bash_profile add umask as umask 0222
 for all the users: goto /etc/profile add umask 0222

Ex:
ec2-user file permission
664
rw- rw- r--
user gp others     -->gp:group

if we create one file devops.txt with ec2-user
user/owner --> ec2-user
group --> ec2-user 
others remaining users like sri sagar vam ....

ec2-user dir permission
775
rwx rwx r-x

chmod: to change file permissions
chmod 777
chmod 444
chmod 740

chmod 777 *.txt ---> change permission to all .txt extension files


chown : to change the ownership.
Note: This command should excute with root user only
Syn:chown username filename
Syn:chown -R username dirname

chgrp:to change group.
syn:chgrp groupname filename

syn: chown username:groupname filename     --> to change user and group name at a time.

Here link file has the same properties which original file have.
syn-softlink: ln -s var/flipcart/flipcart.log tem/flipcartlink.log
To remove link use command : rm or unlink symlink_name

Hard-link                          soft-link
Link file having same as           diff properties
original file properties            like diff inode                 tocheck inode number ls -li
like same inode 
If we deleted original file           if we delete original file
still we can access to link file      we can not access link file
